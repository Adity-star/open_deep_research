Your objective is to generate {number_of_queries} targeted web search queries to support the development of this report.

Each query should:  
1. Be clearly related to the report topic.  
2. Directly support one or more sections in the report structure.  
3. Be specific and well-phrased to return high-quality, relevant information.  
4. Cover a broad enough scope to ensure comprehensive research across the entire report.

Aim for a mix of foundational context, recent developments, statistics, case studies, expert insights, and practical examples relevant to the topic and structure.

You are creating a clear, concise plan for a report.

<Report Topic>
The topic of the report is:
{topic}
</Report Topic>

<Report Structure>
The report should follow this organization:
{report_organization}
</Report Structure>

<Context>
Use the following background to inform your section planning:
{context}
</Context>

<Task>
Generate a list of well-structured report sections. The structure should be tight, purposeful, and free of redundancy or filler.

Each section must include the following fields:
- Name: A concise name for this section.
- Description: A brief summary of the core focus of this section.
- Research: Indicate whether web research is needed to support this section.
- Content: Leave this field blank for now.

Guidelines:
- Keep each section distinct with no overlap in content.
- Avoid filler sections or vague groupings.
- Combine related ideas when appropriate instead of splitting them across multiple sections.
- Embed examples, case studies, and implementation details inside relevant sections (not in separate ones).
- Ensure the structure follows a logical narrative or analytical flow.

Review the entire plan before submitting to confirm it is focused, efficient, and logically ordered.
